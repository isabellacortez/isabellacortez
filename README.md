## Skills

### Classes
I've gained valuable knowledge through various courses, including:
- **COMP 110: Introduction to Programming and Data Science**: Introduces programming and data science from a computational perspective. Emphasis on modern applications in society, problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, and ethics in computing. Foundational concepts include data types, sequences, boolean logic, control flow, functions/methods, recursion, classes/objects, input/output, data organization, transformations, and visualizations.
- **COMP 210: Data Structures and Analysis**: Focuses on organizing data in computer programs for efficient manipulation, especially on large problems and data instances. Covers how libraries of programming languages are constructed and the rationale behind included and excluded items.
- **COMP 290: Essential Tools for Computer Science**: A pilot course for intended Computer Science majors that introduces essential computer science tools and technologies not covered in other classes. Learning methodologies to plan, develop, and present software projects, expanding computer science toolbelt and gaining industry-relevant experience.


### Tools and Programming Languages
I am familiar with several programming languages and tools, including:
- **Python**: Developed small applications and scripts for data analysis.
- **Java**: Implemented data structures and algorithms in various projects.
- **JavaScript**: Created interactive web applications and prototypes.
- **Git**: Utilized version control for collaborative projects.
- **Docker**: Gained experience with containerization for application deployment.
